  - heading: Project Structure
    text: Project contains "Data" folder for lightsaber configuration. Each lightsaber
      named as "A" and "B" has respective folders which contains variables change
      various options.

  - heading: 'Changing lightsaber parameters  '
    text: In data folder you will find "lightsaberA" and "lightsaberA" assets. With
      this asset you can change length of the lightsaber`s handle and laser length.
      You can also change radius of the laser.

  - heading: 'Changing swing parameters  '
    text: In data folder you will find "swingAFromRot" and "swingAToRot" assets for
      both lightsabers A and B. With this asset you can change starting and ending
      coordinates for swing. There is an another asset named "SwingA" and "SwingB"
      which both starting ,ending coordinates as well as duration of swing. You can
      create new paramter file if you wan to change them by right clicking any empty
      space in data folder then select "Create Vector3 Variable". After creating
      rotation parameter you can assing to "SwingA" or "SwingB" assets.

  - heading: Changing slider limits
    text: In data folder you will find "xAMaxAngle" and "xAMinAngle" assets for both
      lightsabers A and B. With this asset you can change starting and ending values
      for slider.

  - heading: Changing collision predicton rate
    text: In Project hierarcy panel you will find "Controllers" game object which
      contains component   named "Swing Collision Prediction". On that component
      you will see slider named "Angle Resulation" which controls how prediction
      is calculated. Default value 1 means it will try every 1 angle change to check
      if there is a collision or not. If you increa value to 8 for example it will
      check collision at every 8 angle change.

  - heading: Changing animation values
    text: In Project hierarcy panel you will find "Controllers" game object which
      contains component   named "Swing Animator". On that component you will see
      value  named "Speed Multiplier" which controls how long animation will take.
      if you increase that number animation will be slower so that you can inspect
      collisions easly. "Animation Reset  Duration" variable is a duration of rewind
      animation which returns to starting state. "Wait After Collision Time" controls
      the waiting time after collsion happens before rewindding to starting state.
      "Wait after swing time " controls waiting time before rewinding if collision
      is  not  occured.

  - heading: Changing lighsaber locations and rotations
    text: In Project hierarcy panel you will find "Container" game object under that
      there will be two new object  "HandA" and "HandB" use the object to freely
      moving and rotating. Using any other games object will lead game to unexpected
      behaviour.
